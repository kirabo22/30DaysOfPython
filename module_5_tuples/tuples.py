# Create an empty tuple

# Create a tuple containing names of your sisters and your brothers (imaginary siblings are fine)
sisters = ('Alice', 'Mary', 'Sophia')
brothers = ('John', 'Michael', 'David')

# Join brothers and sisters tuples and assign it to siblings
siblings = sisters + brothers

# How many siblings do you have?

print(f"I have {siblings_count} siblings.")

# Modify the siblings tuple and add the name of your father and mother and assign it to family_members
family_members = siblings + ('Father', 'Mother')
print("Family members:", family_members)

# Tuple Exercises: Level 2

# Unpack siblings and parents from family_members
*siblings, father, mother = family_members

# Create fruits, vegetables and animal products tuples
